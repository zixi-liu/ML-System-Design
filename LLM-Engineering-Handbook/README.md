## Chapter 1. Understanding the LLM Twin Concept and Architecture

### Understanding the LLM Twin concept
- an LLM Twin is an AI character that incorporates your writing style, voice, and personality into an LLM.
- The key of the LLM Twin stands in the following:
  - What data we collect
  - How we preprocess the data
  - How we feed the data into the LLM
  - How we chain multiple prompts for the desired results
  - How we evaluate the generated content
- The solution is to build an LLM system that encapsulates and automates all the following steps:
  - Data collection
  - Data preprocessing
  - Data storage, versioning, and retrieval
  - LLM fine-tuning
  - RAG
  - Content generation evaluation

### Building ML systems with feature/training/inference pipelines

We have to consider how to do the following:
- Ingest, clean, and validate fresh data
- Training versus inference setups
- Compute and serve features in the right environment
- Serve the model in a cost-effective way
- Version, track, and share the datasets and models
- Monitor your infrastructure and models
- Deploy the model on a scalable infrastructure
- Automate the deployments and training

Our problem is accessing the features to make predictions without passing them at the client’s request.

**Designing the system architecture of the LLM Twin**

Listing the technical details of the LLM Twin architecture
- On the data side, we have to do the following:
  - Collect data from LinkedIn, Medium, Substack, and GitHub completely autonomously and on a schedule
  - Standardize the crawled data and store it in a data warehouse
  - Clean the raw data
  - Create instruct datasets for fine-tuning an LLM
  - Chunk and embed the cleaned data. Store the vectorized data into a vector DB for RAG.
- For training, we have to do the following:
  - Fine-tune LLMs of various sizes (7B, 14B, 30B, or 70B parameters)
  - Fine-tune on instruction datasets of multiple sizes
  - Switch between LLM types (for example, between Mistral, Llama, and GPT)
  - Track and compare experiments
  - Test potential production LLM candidates before deploying them
  - Automatically start the training when new instruction datasets are available.
- The inference code will have the following properties:
  - A REST API interface for clients to interact with the LLM Twin
  - Access to the vector DB in real time for RAG
  - Inference with LLMs of various sizes
  - Autoscaling based on user requests
  - Automatically deploy the LLMs that pass the evaluation step.
- The system will support the following LLMOps features:
  - Instruction dataset versioning, lineage, and reusability
  - Model versioning, lineage, and reusability
  - Experiment tracking
  - Continuous training, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CT/CI/CD)
  - Prompt and system monitoring
